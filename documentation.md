// Backend error handling
Error objects are thrown when runtime errors occur.

whenever using async , try to use try- catch block along with it! or else
create a separate error handler for it!

Middleware!!
The Promise object represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an
asynchronous operation and its resulting value.
